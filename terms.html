  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="muted">Version: 2025-08-29 • Last updated: 30 Aug 2025</p>

  <p>These Terms of Service (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) govern your access to and use of IQChess, including our mobile and web apps, websites, content, products, and services (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”). By creating an account, accessing, or using the Services you agree to these Terms.</p>

  <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Services. If you are between 13 and the age of majority where you live, you may use the Services only with consent of a parent or legal guardian who accepts these Terms.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>3) Accounts & Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide accurate information; keep your credentials secure; you’re responsible for all activity under your account.</li>
    <li>We may offer social sign-in (e.g., Apple, Google, Facebook) or email/password via Amazon Cognito. Your use of those identity providers is also subject to their terms.</li>
    <li>You may delete your account any time in-app; deletion is permanent and revokes access to purchased tokens that remain unused, except where required by law or platform policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Virtual Tokens & Purchases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We may offer in-app virtual tokens or credits (“<strong>Tokens</strong>”) that can be consumed to access features such as engine or AI analysis. Tokens are <strong>not legal tender</strong>, have <strong>no cash value</strong>, and are <strong>non-transferable</strong> except as permitted in the app.</li>
    <li>Purchases are processed by the platform you use (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play) or by our payment partner(s) for web. Pricing and taxes are displayed at checkout.</li>
    <li>Except where required by law or the platform’s policies, <strong>all Token sales are final</strong>. If a platform grants a refund for a purchase, we may revoke or deduct the corresponding Tokens/features from your account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Subscriptions (if offered)</h2>
  <p>If we offer auto-renewing subscriptions, the specific details (price, period, benefits) will be disclosed at purchase. Subscriptions renew automatically until canceled in your platform account settings. Partial-period refunds are not provided except as required by law or platform policy.</p>

  <h2>6) Acceptable Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No cheating, exploiting, reverse engineering, scraping, or interfering with gameplay or Services.</li>
    <li>No unlawful, harassing, defamatory, hateful, misleading, or infringing content. No bots unless explicitly permitted.</li>
    <li>Respect rate limits and security measures. Don’t attempt to access other users’ data.</li>
    <li>We may monitor, investigate, remove content, and suspend/terminate accounts for violations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) User Content & License</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You retain your rights to content you submit (e.g., usernames, chat, game records), but you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (e.g., format/translate), publicly display and perform, and distribute your content solely to operate, improve, and promote the Services.</li>
    <li>Do not upload content you don’t have rights to. You are responsible for your content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) AI & Analysis Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We may provide engine and/or AI-generated annotations, analysis, and recommendations. These outputs can be inaccurate or inappropriate. They are provided for informational and entertainment purposes only and are not professional advice.</li>
    <li>You agree not to rely on AI outputs for decisions where errors could cause harm.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9) Intellectual Property; DMCA</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Services, including software, logos, and content we provide, are protected by IP laws and licensed to you on a limited, revocable, non-transferable basis to use solely with the Services.</li>
    <li>If you believe content infringes your copyright, send a notice to <a href="mailto:copyright@iqchess.org">copyright@iqchess.org</a> with: (a) your contact info, (b) the work claimed infringed, (c) the specific location/URL, (d) a statement under penalty of perjury that you own or are authorized, and (e) your signature. We may remove content and terminate repeat infringers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10) Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We rely on third parties such as Amazon Web Services (hosting and authentication), Apple/Google (distribution and payments), payment processors, and analytics providers. Their terms and privacy policies apply in addition to these Terms.</p>

  <h2>11) Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation, or that defects will be corrected.</p>

  <h2>12) Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID US (IF ANY) IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM AROSE.</p>

  <h2>13) Indemnity</h2>
  <p>You will indemnify and hold us harmless from any claim, liability, damages, losses, and costs (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your content, your use of the Services, or your violation of these Terms or law.</p>

  <h2>14) Suspension & Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access at any time if we believe you violated these Terms or pose a risk. You may stop using the Services at any time and can delete your account in-app. Sections intended to survive (e.g., IP, disclaimers, liability limits) will survive termination.</p>

  <h2>15) Governing Law & Venue</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Québec and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules. The courts located in Montréal, Québec have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute, except where consumer protection laws grant you rights to bring actions in your home jurisdiction.</p>

  <h2>16) Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms; the “Last updated” date shows when. Material changes will be notified in-app or on our website. Continued use after changes means you accept them.</p>
